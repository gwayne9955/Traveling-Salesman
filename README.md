# Traveling-Salesman
Traveling Salesman Algorithm in Swift

A work in progress. This algorithm finds the shortest route from a city to a list of other cities, ending up back at the starting city. This algorithm succeeds to find the shortest distance with the use of a dynamic programming algorithm that can solve the problem in time O(n^2*2^n) where n is the number of cities in the graph.
